tensorflow (2.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 2.0.0 (Oct 2019).
  * Rewrite the buildsystem, which reconstructs the dependency graph
    by parsing the Bazel buildlog, and subsequently generates a Ninja
    build to approximate the original build sequence.
    + Bazel2Json.py: reads build command sequence from raw buildlog
      of bazel, and stores result into a json file.
    + Json2Ninja.py: read build sequence from json file, understand
      each command line and rebuild the dependency graph. It also
      scans the C++ header includes to avoid surprising FTBFS.
  * Build the following 3 shared objects (standard tensorflow v2):
    + libtensorflow_framework.so.2  (foundamental lib)
    + libtensorflow.so.2            (C interface)
    + libtensorflow_cc.so.2         (C++ interface)

  [ BuildSystem ]
  * Significantly simplified code of shogun.py .
  * Add -DNDEBUG and -pipe to default CXXFLAGS.

    for the upcoming TensorFlow 2.X series.

  * Initial release [1.10.1+dfsg]. (Closes: #804612)

  * Many thanks to Aron Xu <aron@debian.org> for his sponsorship
    of the access to his build machine which helped a lot.
  * Many thanks to Boyuan Yang <byang@debian.org> for FTBFS report.
